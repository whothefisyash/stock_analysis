# Stock Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting stock prices using various machine learning models, including LSTM, ARIMA, Prophet, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. The goal is to analyze historical stock price data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build predictive models to forecast future prices.

## File Structure
- `trainee.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the complete analysis and implementation of the models. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
- `data.csv`: This file contains the raw stock price data used for analysis.
- `updated_data.csv`: This file is the English version of `data.csv`, making it easier for non-native speakers to understand the dataset.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- statsmodels
- tensorflow
- fbprophet (or `prophet` for newer versions)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn statsmodels tensorflow prophet
```

## How to Run the Program
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/whothefisyash/stock_analysis.git
   cd stock_analysis
   ```

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**  
   Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open `trainee.ipynb` from the Jupyter interface.

3. **Run the Notebook**  
   Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to perform the analysis, model training, and evaluation. The notebook includes code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and performance evaluation.

4. **View Results**  
   Visualizations of the stock price predictions and model performance metrics will be displayed within the notebook.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of building and evaluating various machine learning models for stock price prediction. You can experiment with the models and parameters to improve the predictions further.
